Reprogram routing of AEX boards
===============================

Those who want to create their own AEX version, have to first checkout the code
from https://x.ethz.ch/svn/aer/fpga

Therein, the AEX project file for Xilinx ISE is: ``aex/aex.ise``.
The top VHDL file is: ``aextop/z_top.vhd``.

Once you downladed the fpga code you can open the file 'aex/aex.ise'. On the
left panel, 'Sources', blablabla.

.. note:: If you encounter problems you can always go back to revision 1564 of
          the ``aex.ise`` file, rename it as you want, for example ``aex2.ise``,
          and go on with your modifications

In the top file, at the beginning, just after the entity declaration, you find
all the configuration settings. The configuration is with respect to paths
between the three interfaces, denoted as P, S, U for Parallel, Serial and USB.
There are 3^3 = 9 combinations so 9 possible path to configure. At first, each
path can be enabled or disabled completely. These are the first nine constants,
with the names ``confPathEnableXYxS``, with XY being PP, PS, PU, SP, and so on...

If ``0`` is assigned to a path, it is disabled.
Then there are four configuration values for each path,

- confXYFilterRangeMinxDI with default x"00000000"
- confXYFilterRangeMaxxDI with default x"FFFFFFFF"
- confXYOutMaskAndxDI with default x"FFFFFFFF"
- confXYOutMaskOrxDI with default x"00000000"

with XY being the same as before.
An address A coming to the path is checked to be in the range::

    A >= confXYFilterRangeMinxDI and A >= confFilterRangeMaxxDI

If not, the address is discarded. If the filter check is passed, A is used to
calculate Anew in the following way::

    Anew <= (A and confXYOutMaskAndxDI) or confXYOutMaskOrxDI

This gives us the possibility to make the trick. Notice first that we have to
distinguish if an event is input for a chip or output from a chip, because of
monitoring purposes. This reduces the address space. The range filtering is
used by an AEX for checking if an address has to be sent to its chip. The 'or'
mask is used for adding the stamp. The 'and' mask is used for cleaning the bits
before stamping.

For example, if we had 8 bits, 5 for neurons addressing:

#. 01011010 (0x5A) comes from the mapper
#. it is for chip number 010 (0x40)
#. this cause activity on chip 010
#. chip 010 stamp its activity with 110 (add 0xC0 to the address)
#. mapper finds 0xC0 + 0x14 and then knows who is the sender
#. mapper maps this activity to someone else...

Note that each event add an address in the communication loop. If nobody removed
it, the chain would soon saturate. The idea is then to stamp a chip output
address in a different way of a chip input address. * better explanation
please...*

Each AEX board will have its own configuration because the filter and stamp
change. For example, for Chip1::

    constant confSPFilterRangeMinxDI : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0) :=x"0000A000";
    constant confSPFilterRangeMaxxDI : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0) :=x"0000AFFF";
    constant confSPOutMaskAndxDI     : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0) :=x"FFFF1FFF";
    constant confSPOutMaskOrxDI      : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0) :=x"00002000";

The path enabled are PS, PU, SP, SU, US for all the AEXs.

The files created are in 'fpga/aextop' folder:

- ``z_top_CH1.vhd``
- ``z_top_CH2.vhd``
- ``z_top_CH3.vhd``
- ``z_top_RS.vhd``

Notes and common problems in programming AEX
--------------------------------------------

The ise project file is automagically saved in any moment... If you do
something wrong like removing all the sources on the left panel, this change
will persist even if you close the project without explicitly saving.  - At the
end of the process, be sure that only D2 led is on and the others are off. Once
you connect the board to the USB you should se D1 and D3 on and D2 off. Please
notice that this is a possible check but is *not* exhaustive.

Going further
-------------

The loop design we described before is the simplest one can think of. This
setup will work with an input (retina or sequencer) and 3 chips, 2Difwta or
ifslwta.  An other possibility is to use the fact that ifslwta chips use a
lower number of bits for neurons and synapses addressing. This means that in
principal it is possible to use one retina and up to 6 ifslwta *is it true?*. 

Anyway we implemented this before in order to see if everything is going to
work or not, then after we can think about something more general.
