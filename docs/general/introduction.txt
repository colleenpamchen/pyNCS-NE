Description of the Chips Developed at INI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our VLSI chips can be interfaced to computers via custom "AEX" boards, and
among each other via a custom "mapper" board. The AEX boards are controlled by
an FPGA (Filed Programmable Gate Array) which routes the communications between
serial (i.e. other chips and mapper), parallel (i.e. the chip) and usb ports
(i.e. the user's computer). Here is a brief tutorial on how to use these
boards, how they are configured in a multi-chip setup, and how to re-program
the FPGAs on the AEX boards to suit your needs.

:IFSLWTA:

    This chip contains a 1D sheet consisting of 128 IAF neurons, 4 of them receive
    excitation from the other 124 and inhibit them back. Each row has 32 synapses,
    2 excitatory, 2 inhibitory, 28 excitatory plastic synapses. Neurons have local
    connections to first and second neighbour. Plasticity acts as a 2 state switch:
    each synapse (28*128) can be turned on or off by learning. If it happens that
    one synapse has a value between the on and off values, it will be pushed to the
    nearest one according to a set of thresholds.

    This chip shows the Stop-Learning algorithm (Brader et al., 2007; Mitra et al.,
    2009).

    Uses 12/16bits for neuron addressing.

:2DIFWTA:

    This chip is a 2D matrix of 32*64 IAF neurons similar to the ifslwta ones. Each
    neuron has 2 excitatory connections (synapses 1-2) and 1 inhibitory (synapse 0). Local connections are
    with the nearest neighbour (can be limited to 1/2 vertical neighbours +/- 1 lateral/diagonal neighbours).
    Uses 13/16bits for neuron addressing.
    There is a *bug* in this chip that generates illegal events on the AER bus :
    Every time an inhibitory synapse of a neuron with a Y coordinate of (4n+2) or
    (4n+3) is addressed, the system gets into a hung-up state and all AEX boards
    have to be restarted in order to make it work again !

The AER interface board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AER chips need to be interfaced to the outer world. We developed a custom board
to route signals from/to the chip to/from a usb connected computer and a serial
bus for multi-chip and mapping capabilities.

An AEX board has three I/O channels:
USB, Parallel, Serial. USB protocol is used for communication with an external
PC for monitoring, bias settings and stimulation. Parallel port gives access to
the chip through the AMDA and daughter board. Serial communication is used by
the mapper via the AER protocol. The board is controlled by a Xilinx ***model***
32bits FPGA chip. Refer to D. Fasnacht Master thesis for more infos.
The mapper receives spike events from the chip with a stamp which identifies the
neuron that emitted that spike. A mapping table is compiled on the mapper so
every incoming event can be sent to other neurons as they were
connected by a synapse. Mapper has a I/O serial interface (16bit). Refer to D.
Fasnacht documentation.

The mapper
~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you have N chips (so N AEX boards, AMDAs and daughter boards). Using one
mapper you can arbitrarily connect neurons of these chips, building complex networks.

We have two setups currently available:

 * the `Zenzero setup <hardware-setups#the-zenzero-setup>`_
 * the `Zaex setup <hardware-setups#the-zaex-setup>`_

Refer to those pages for details on how to use these existing setups. If you
want to arrange a chip in a new multichip setup, you have to reprogram the AEX
board's FPGA, where informations are routed and filtered properly.

Please notice that what you are going to reprogram is only valid for a specific
setup, so before going into any modification prepare the setup you want to
arrange. For example: 1 2Difwta and 1 ifslwta.  The serial connections are
arranged in a loop chain as 

========== === ===========   
Source         Destination
========== === ===========   
Mapper OUT --> Chip1 IN
---------- --- -----------   
Chip1 OUT  --> Chip2 IN
---------- --- -----------   
...
---------- --- -----------   
ChipN OUT  --> Mapper IN
========== === ===========   

ChipN is connected to the user's PC via USB. An address coming from the mapper
is checked by each AEX board and sent to the next chip. If it is an address for
ChipM, AEX board number M will also send the message to its chip via Parallel
port. This message will pass through each AEX until the mapper rejects it (see
next section for details).  An address coming from ChipL will be stamped by its
AEX board.  Chip addressing use the bits that are not used for neurons
addressing.  Of course there are some limitations. The first one can think of
is a bandwith limitation, the amount of information per time unit the chain can
process.

In this design we will suppose that mapper capabilities are enough to route all
the incoming events without sensible deviations from the ideal case. This can
be false in particular cases.  The second is in the address space. Each chip
needs a certain amount of bits for the addressing of neurons. The bigger the
chip (N neurons), the higher the number (~logN). While the AEX boards can
manage 32bits data, the mapper serial communication is 16bits so 16 bits are
the maximum number of bits one can use for chip and neurons addressing. The
design must consider the maximum amount of bits for neurons addressing and what
remains for chip addressing. The design presented here refers to the use of 1
Retina and 3 2Difwta chip. One can even choose not to use the retina and use
the sequencer instead. They cannot be used together at the same time. You can
use either 2Difwta and/or ifslwta chips. Once you program the AEX you cannot
change the position of an AEX in the chain * is it true? *.  2Difwta uses 13/16
bits, so we have 3 bits left for chips addressing. Retina chip uses 15/16 bits
but here we can use only 13 of them restricting the size of the retina. The 8
resulting addresses are as follows.

--------------   -------
Chip 1 IN:       001

Chip 2           110
--------------   -------
Chip 3           111
==============   =======

Each setup needs one (and only one) special channel 0 board. This board doesn't
transmit mapped events (i.e. inputs for the chips) through the serial-to-serial
path. This means it has to be the last one on the chain and the one that is
used to send events from usb to the chain. This serial-to-serial filtering has
been introduced after realizing that the mapper cannot receive mapped events,
otherwise the chain is blocked. Please notice that because of this you cannot
use channel 4 (retina input) for the sequencer: your events would be trashed by
the special aex.
