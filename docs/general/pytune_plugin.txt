pyTune plugins explained
========================

pyTune controls neuromorphic system by means of plugins. A plugin basically
translates pyTune informations (classes, methods, attributes, keywords, ...)
into system-specific ones. For example, the pyNCS plugin for pyTune contains
methods for setting the biases of the chips when calling ``set`` functions.
Once a new plugin is implemented, all the features of pyTune should be
available right away.
